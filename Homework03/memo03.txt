TMP101: 
The TI-TMP101 has one Pin that is used to configure its address so that more than one of the same IC can be used on one bus. There are three modes: Pullup, Pulldown and floating that all result in a different address of the TMP.

Slew Rate: The slew rate defines how fast a edge rises/falls if the voltage of an outputpin is changed. This is important if you got capacitative load like the gate of a big MOS-FET.

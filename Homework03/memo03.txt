Assignments:
============

TMP101: 
-------
The TI-TMP101 has one Pin that is used to configure its address so that more than one of the same IC can be used on one bus. There are three modes: Pullup, Pulldown and floating that all result in a different address of the TMP. 
Setting the thresholds of both 101's with system()
Reading the interrupts with a modified file from ridgerun ...
converting the read value with bc to farenheit 

=> Everything works and can be demoed. 

Etch-a-Sketch:
--------------
Level-converter is wired up and works. 
Can see the ledmatrix on 0x70 on the bus.
Demo in /exercises/i2c/ also works on matrix.

Size in default configuration:

644K busybox

When just using ls ( and I was not able to deselect ip for some reason, and one other checkbox)

36K busybox

Adding httpd leads to a increase in the filesize of 12K

48K busybox

When I deselect utilities I never use then I get the following filesize, telnet was deselected for example.  

432K busybox


Static linking

The filesize was:

1.2M busybox

Yes it still works.

Running a web server:

Busybox was compiled with static linked libraries and the httpd selected. The memory size was also 1.2M. Maybe it did not show a difference due to the scaling. (Just some kb added). Setting up a small webpage called index.html in the directory where the httpd was started lead to the display of the webpage when pointing a browser to it.

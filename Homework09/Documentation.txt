My matrixLED.js only controls one of the two LEDs in the matrix. Your task is to make it 

control both LEDS. One approach would be to have the first click turn on the Green LED, the 2nd

turn on both, the 3rd

1. Before writing any code, write a paragraph describing how boneServer.js and the browser 

interact in the given example. For example, in matrixLED.js connect() is called to make 

a connection between the browser and the bone. The message “matrix” is sent to the 

bone. What happens in response to the message? 



2. What happens when an “LED” is clicked on in the browser?



3. What entry in matrix.css is used to color the LED?

The attribute backgroundcolour is used to define the colour of the LED. 




4. Write a high level paragraph about how you will control the two LEDs. What messages 

will be sent between the browser and the bone?



5. Write your code. Do you need to change boneServer.js? (I don’t think so.)
